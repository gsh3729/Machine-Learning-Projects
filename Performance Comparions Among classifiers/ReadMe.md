## Objective:  
Compare performance of classifiers based on iris dataset from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris  

Below is the list of classifiers:  
- Decision Trees
- Perceptron
- Neural Net
- Deep Learning
- SVM
- naÃ¯ve Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Bagging
- Random Forests
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting


------   
Languages used: Python 2.7.10  
Package used: Python's scikit-learn  
Two source files: findbest.py and testall.py  
- findbest.py: finding best parameters for each classifier  
- testall.py: testing all classifiers together  
This program is tested in terminal from MacOS 10.12.3     

------  
**How to compile and run code**:  
1. Open terminal and set the path to where the source code is located at   
2. Enter command:  
  > python findbest.py   
3. Or enter command:  
  > python testall.py
