## Objective:  
In order to use unsupervised learning to decrease the number of color points in an image, image segmentation using k-means are implemented. OpenCV pacakage is used.

------  

Languages used: Python 2.7.10  
Package used: OpenCV  
source filename: imageSeg.py  
This program is tested in terminal from MacOS 10.12.3    

------  

How to compile and run code:  
1.Open terminal and set the path to where the source code is located at   
2.Enter command:  
    > python 3.py   

------  

Note:  
1. This image clustering processing will take about 1 minute.  
2. 3 output images are saved under folder /partIII/clusteredImages/
